#Text as Networks

A large proportion of the world's knowledge, especially scholarly knowledge is
written into documents of all sorts: papers, articles, manuals, guides, books or
pamphlets. In the world of Computers &amp; Data, this 'free text' is referred to
as unstructured data, and is often viewed with trepidation and suspicion. Lying
in wait between the tokens are complex networks at different interpretative
levels, from grammatical patterns, to events linking people, places and times.
This talk will discuss some of the ways that humanities scholars can use
computational methods to uncover the networks in text, and to put them to use.

## Structured vs. Unstructured

What to encode, and how to encode it?

## Networks of Things -- Cendari

* Ontologies
* Entities and Language

## Networks of Words -- Topic Models and n-grams

* Distant Reading, Topic Shifts and Trends
* Word Embeddings -- towards conceptual algebra

## Networks of Characters -- LSTM

Learning to speak, learning to code

## Networks of People
